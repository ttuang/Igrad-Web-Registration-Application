This is a project that I developed with three of my other classmates for our senior project. We have
teamed up with Khalsa Gurmat School to develop a Web application in a professional
environment with our skill sets and utilizing the most up-to-date technology. Khalsa Gurmat
Center is an independent community based non-profit organization focused on education,
empowerment and civic engagement for kids and community members. Our mission was to
design and develop a website that will allow students to register to the school through the
website. And the school administrator will be able to view the number of applicants that applied
to the school and view the applicantsâ€™ information. Our goal was to deliver a workable web
registration system to Khalsa Gurmat School that they can use in the near future. We developed
the web registration system using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL for data collections.
